          I&apos;m Wassim Zaoui, I&apos;ve been learning programming for over 3
          years. My favorite part of programming is the problem-solving of
          finally figuring out a solution to a problem. I&apos;ve had the
          opportunity to work on several exciting projects on my learning
          journey. My core stack is React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind
          CSS. I&apos;m looking to learn new technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m open to Job opportunities where I can contribute, learn and
          grow. If you have a good opportunity that matches my skills and
          experience then don&apos;t hesitate to contact me.
        </p>
